Here are some potential next steps:

Try to segment the data by columns like Education, Location (Census Region), and Which character shot first?, which aren't binary. Are they any interesting patterns?
Clean up columns 15 to 29, which have to do with what characters are viewed favorably and unfavorably.
Which character is the most liked?
Which character is the most disliked?
Which character creates the most controversy? (split between dislikes and likes)
